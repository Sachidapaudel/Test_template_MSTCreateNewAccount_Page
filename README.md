# Registration Page Testing for "My Second Teacher" Learning App:
  As part of a personal project, I conducted thorough testing of the registration page for the "My Second Teacher" learning app. The focus was on ensuring both design fidelity and functional integrity. 
  Key activities included:

Design Verification: Ensured the registration page design matched the provided Figma/Canva design specifications.
Field Validation: Confirmed that all required fields were marked appropriately with an asterisk (*) and that the "Create my account" button remained disabled until all fields were correctly filled.
User Input Validation: Tested the registration process to prevent account creation with blank fields, previously used email addresses, and invalid email or phone number formats.
Successful Registration: Verified that users could successfully create new accounts using valid information, ensuring smooth user onboarding.

The tests were largely successful, demonstrating my ability to identify and address minor issues, such as missing asterisks on required fields and the need for front-end validation messages to improve user experience. This project showcased my attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and commitment to quality in software development.
